NOTES about these structures:

1. These 30 protein structures were superposed to 4OBO-monomer_Stage1 (one of the protein
   structure supplied to the participants during stage 1 of the challenge).

2. ONLY subunit A is supplied (monomer) for stage 2 of the challenge. 
   ALL had two chains. However, subunit B is APO (no ligand) and therefore was deleted as well as 
   its waters.
